<h1>Hey buddy</h1>
<p>God, feels like an age since you asked me to draw you as a pixel art character? That would have been back when I had that art style, probably like 3-4 years ago now. Gosh.</p>
<p>Anyway, I thought I'd finally get off my lazy butt and give you a graphical version of yourself.</p>
<p>Enjoy the bonus pelliper.</p>
<p>Nah but seriously I hope you have a great time. I got to update this text after meeting you (well, yesterday when you read this). It's been a nice reminder that you're one of those most wonderful people (of whom there are 7 in my life at the moment). Such people are defined by the fact that whenever I meet you, I always leave a happy person. If I can bring half the cheer and optimism into your life as you can bring to mine, them damn I must be amazing.</p>
<p>Love ya buddy. Have a wonderful day with your wonderful family, and an incredible new year.</p>
<p>And rest assured that, up in the mountains, watching the replay of me using Jigglypuff's sing on you from the ledge before resting for the game winning kill, I will be thinking of you.</p>

<p class="signoff">Big ol' hugs, Hannah.</p>
<p>PS: If you ever want the "you" character posed in a more senible way, just ask. I'm sure I can do something</p>
